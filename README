The code here has been adapted to run in parallel either on a standalone machine or across a cluster
using the MPI libraries and a modified version of repastHPC v2.2.0 downloaded from https://repast.github.io/repast_hpc.html

Build instructions can be found in INSTALL.txt

Once you have the mad_model executable, depending on how your system is set up you may then need to set the system variable

LD_LIBRARY_PATH

in order for the model to find shared libraries - see e.g. the file LIBS which also
makes sure the path to the MPICH executalbes is set. You can check that all shared
libraries can be found with:-

ldd ./mad_model

Run the model with the following incantation:-

mpi_run -np <no of threads> ./mad_model config.props model.props

The value in <no of threads> MUST be consistent with the total number of threads
specified in model.props or the run will immediately crash. 
e.g. if 

proc.per.x = 3 
proc.per.y = 2

then use

mpi_run -np 6 ./mad_model config.props model.props

Parameters in model.props can also be changed on the command line e.g.

mpirun  -np 1 ./mad_model config.props model.props proc.per.x=1 proc.per.y=1 stop.at=2

See model.props for a list of model parameters.

For the behaviour of config.props consult the repast_hpc documentation.
