As a pre-requisite for building the model you first need to follow the instructions in 
repast_hpc-2.2.0_modified_build/INSTALL.txt This will allow you to install a 
*modified* version of the original repast_hpc code. Please note that the model
**will not work** with the original version of repast_hpc-2.2.0 as some of the assumptions
in the original code are not obeyed by the madingley model (in particular those relating
to contiguity of cells on agent movement).
The repast_hpc install will also include a suitable version of netcdf and netcdf-cxx
(this version has been tested with netcdf-c-4.6.2 and netcdf-cxx-4.3.0).

Edit the Makefile provided in this directory and ensure that the location of the
necessary repast_hpc libraries and BASE_DIR are consistent with the above install
of repast_hpc.

You should then be able to do
make all
in this directory to build the mad_model executable.
