Added arbitrary co-ordinate location to cohorts (up to double precision)
Added a "direct" dispersal method that uses the above co-ordinates to move cohorts (rather than probabilisitic dispersal only at cell co-ordinates)
Added cross-grid cell interaction - this is quite a lot more expensive, but allows cells to be dynamically coupled (so e.g. waves are now possible)
