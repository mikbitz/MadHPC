Added arbitrary co-ordinate location to cohorts (up to double precision)
Added a "direct" dispersal method that uses the above co-ordinates to move cohorts (rather than probabilisitic dispersal only at cell co-ordinates)
Added cross-grid cell interaction - this is quite a lot more expensive, but allows cells to be dynamically coupled (so e.g. waves are now possible)
Added a Human class that looks just like the Cohort class, but is essentially just a warm-blooded omnivore
5/4/2019
Updated cross-grid cell interaction to make sure plant data gets synced properly - removes some artefacts in output
16/4/2019
Corrected cross-grid cell interaction to transmit cell and cohort random orderings across threads
Added a sequencer in cohort to ensure random orderings preserved across threads
Reduced data transfers needed in cohorts by reading in some data from cohort definitions in cohort package
Added some switches to turn in and off parts of the dynamics to aid with testing
Bug fixes in direct dispersal to correct for Eastern boundary grid-cell locations (still some artefacts at dateline)
Bug fix in selection of direct or probabilistic dispersal
18/4/2019
Bug fix in range of overlap cells used in loop over cells (although overlap buffer=2 for consistency), range for dynamics =1)
