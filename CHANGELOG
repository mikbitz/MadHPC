Updated model.cpp to allow multiple passes across cohorts when doing cross-cell updates. Cohorts are now batched into nine subsets corresponding to cells in a Moore neighbourhood so that aysnchronous updates can be made self-consistent acroos cores
using a buffer width of 2 and shared random sequences. This works provided the cross-cell interaction range is less than about a quarter cell. Plant model updates are done separately, and cohorts access the plants within theor own cell, as the plant
model looks at present more like a field than an individual-based model.

BUGFIX: on restarts the Timestep year was not being calcuate correctly.

BUGFIX: In the global outputs the total cohort biomass was incorrectly calculated from the accumulating spatial map. Now fixed.
modesl.props file updated and commented. switches included so that dynamics can be turned off in sections.

Agents data can now be exported into restart files, which save all agents in boost::archives. These are directly compatible with the code that transfers agents across cores. so makes output and input straightforward. Each core will write its own restart file. On input any number of cores can be used, possibly different from the original, since core 0 is responsible for the input: restart are read one core at a time and then synced to their relevant new core locations as each restart file is read. Some intricacy results from needing to be sure that agent ids are kept unique on the new set of cores. Note that the mapping of agents to cores is not guaranteed to be preserved on restart even if the number of cores is the same. At present random sequences are not preserved across runs, so the details of the output following a restart will generally differ from what would have been obtained from the original run (presently unclear how this is do-able - requires move away from using the supplied Repast random class), even though the starting state will be the same. However, this does allow for a long initial run to be done to allow transients in the distributions over funtional groups, and spatial variability to be worked though.
Formats available are text (possibly transportable) and binary (smaller by about a factor of two, but less portable). Xml is in principle includeable, but currently problematic in compile.

The simplification of data input has now allowed for interpolation in space and time to be added. Model timesteps and model grid now need not align with input timesteps for input grids. Input data can have different space and time resolution if needed (although care must be taken that the data "fits" at the land-sea boundary). Data will be interpolated to positions of agents bilinearly interpolated in space and linearly in time. Model grid can now be a finer resolution than the input data, although this will lead to some smoothing of things like coastlines.

The input file reading has been simplified and the level of indirection reduced. Layers.h now concentrates mainly on 2D only, with and without time.
Multiple files previously assocaited with input now removed.

Bug fix in range of overlap cells used in loop over cells (although overlap buffer=2 for consistency), range for dynamics =1)
16/4/2019
Corrected cross-grid cell interaction to transmit cell and cohort random orderings across threads
Added a sequencer in cohort to ensure random orderings preserved across threads
Reduced data transfers needed in cohorts by reading in some data from cohort definitions in cohort package
Added some switches to turn in and off parts of the dynamics to aid with testing
Bug fixes in direct dispersal to correct for Eastern boundary grid-cell locations (still some artefacts at dateline)
Bug fix in selection of direct or probabilistic dispersal

Updated cross-grid cell interaction to make sure plant data gets synced properly - removes some artefacts in output
1/4/2019
Added arbitrary co-ordinate location to cohorts (up to double precision)
Added a "direct" dispersal method that uses the above co-ordinates to move cohorts (rather than probabilisitic dispersal only at cell co-ordinates)
Added cross-grid cell interaction - this is quite a lot more expensive, but allows cells to be dynamically coupled (so e.g. waves are now possible)
Added a Human class that looks just like the Cohort class, but is essentially just a warm-blooded omnivore
