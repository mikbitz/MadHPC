The files here provide support libraries for repasthpc, but also provide a makefile
for repasthpc itself. Edit the Makefile as appropriate in order to build the libraries.
NB you need to have MPICH available *before* building the boost library - MB 2019 
See INSTALL.txt in the parent directory for installation
instructions.
